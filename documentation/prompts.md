# Question
I need to account for a larger background image for the Main Menu screen of my Phaser.js, sized 1024 x 1024 from 512 x 384. What do I need to update in my code to do so? Attached are my relevant assets.

# Question
Can you update this Main Menu screen in Phaser.js v3.88.2 to include basic "breathing" animation? I want to the overall background and the pipes sort of look like they are "breathing" and "moving" in a cyber-punk kind of way. I've uploaded the image here as well.
